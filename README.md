### Installation
1. Go to your taiga installation folder and navigate to the `data\theme\Default` directory.
2. Make a backup of the default icons. Create a `.old` folder, cut and paste the folders `16px` and `24px` and the file `Theme.xml`.
3. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/maisans-maid/TaigaFluenticonTheme/releases/), and extract the contents to that folder.
4. Restart the app `(file -> Exit)`

### Restoring old theme
Copy contents from `.old` folder to the `data\theme\Default` directory.

### About this theme
This is a simple replacement of default icons on the install directory. You can make your own icons following the proper image size and format.

### Dark Title Bar
Dark title bars are modified through a [registry edit](https://www.onmsft.com/how-to/how-to-get-dark-theme-title-bars-in-windows-10-without-changing-your-accent-colour). Before attempting to edit the regestry, make sure to create a system restore point in your device.
